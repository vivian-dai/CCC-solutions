# CCC-solutions

Contains thought process and solution code for some of the CCC questions I've solved. Thought process will be in a markdown file, code will likely be in C++ Java and Python unless I get lazy and exclude one of those languages. This is an attempt to aim at being as easily comprehensible as possible so that *I* will be able to know what the heck I was doing when I look back at it later.

## Issues

Use [issues](https://github.com/vivian-dai/CCC-solutions/issues) to point out problems with current code (eg. TLE or some error occurs), say some part of whatever code/solution writeup is unclear, or bully me into adding a writeup to a specific problem. True, this is mostly intended for myself but I see no reason for this to exist without others being able to learn from it.

# CCC-solutions

Contains thought process and solution code for some of the CCC questions I've solved. Thought process will be in a markdown file, code will likely be in C++ Java and Python unless I get lazy and exclude one of those languages. This is an attempt to aim at being as easily comprehensible as possible so that *I* will be able to know what the heck I was doing when I look back at it later.

# Jerseys
Problem description [here](https://cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/computing/2015/stage%201/seniorEn.pdf)

## Solution Code
* [Python](./main.py)

## Approach
There can only be one athlete who gets each jersey number therefore the only thing necessary for being checked is whether the number at which the athelete wants the jersey has a jersey that satisfies them. If multiple atheletes want the same jersey only one can be satisfied anyways.
